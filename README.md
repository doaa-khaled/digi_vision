# digi_vision assessment
please find the solution of (problem solving Q) in first_question.java file
and find the solution of (db Q) in second_question.sql file
and for system design task it's on branch master
the system wasn't clear enough to me 
I assumed that permission group has specific values and these values will be loaded by call api called /initate-permission-groups
and with creation of any item type we will add new permissions to the creator
